🚀 Project Journey

This isn’t just a car — it’s a journey from basic to badass:
	1.	🚘 Stage 1 – Basic Motion:
Got the wheels turning using Arduino and the L298D. Car moved… but with a mind of its own (no control yet!).
	2.	🎮 Stage 2 – Joystick Control:
Wired in a joystick and gained full directional control. Felt like a gamer on wheels.
	3.	💻 Stage 3 – Serial Monitor Navigation:
Sent commands directly from the Arduino Serial Monitor to drive the car. Manual but efficient.
	4.	📱 Stage 4 – Bluetooth + Dabble:
The final boss. Hooked up the HC-05 and controlled the car via smartphone using the Dabble app. Wireless, effortless, awesome.
