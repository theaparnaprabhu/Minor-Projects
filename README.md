# Minor-Projects

A collection of minor but meaningful projects built before my engineering journey. Includes hands-on work with Arduino, sensors, and motors!

## Contents:

1. **Automatic Drive – Thru**  
   A prototype automation of vehicle movement through a toll gate using IR sensors and servo-based gate control.

2. **Arduino BluRover** – A car controlled either through Joystick, Serial Monitor, or via HC-05 Bluetooth Module.  
   👉 This project was featured in the **Community Pulse** by **Arm**, recognizing its innovation and beginner-friendly design.

3. **EchoMeter** – A distance measuring device built with an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno.  
   🔊 *“Listens like a bat, reports like a boss”* – EchoMeter shows real-time distances in both centimeters and meters, helping visualize the invisible.

4. **EchoMeter with DHT11** - An integrated Arduino project that combines distance sensing using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with temperature and humidity monitoring via the DHT11 sensor. Ideal for learning sensor fusion and real-time environmental data collection.
